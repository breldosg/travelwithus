                    "The Gods’ Garden" <br>
                    The history of the park goes back to 1870, when Fredrick Elton, an Explorer visited the area. In
                    1960’s a large area was taken by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization for Wheat and
                    Sheep Schemes. Since neither wheat nor sheep thrived in the area, in 1972 the area was turned to a
                    dairy farm, which remains active to date.

                </p>
                <p>
                    As a result of concerns from conservation bodies and various stakeholders, part of the farm,
                    Livingstone and Nhumbe Forest Reserves were declared as Kitulo National Park on 16th of September
                    2005.

                        <p>
                            The climate is influenced by altitude, Lake Nyasa and is largely temperate. The maximum daily
                            temperature varies from 14.5°c to 18°c and minimum ambient temperature ranges from 7°c to 8°c
                            between December and April, and can go as low as 0.5˚c during June to August ,during this period
                            frost occurs. The average annual rainfall is 1600mm ranging from 1500 – 1700mm. The rain season
                            begins from October to May.

                            documented so far from the plateau. Kitulo highlands appear to be a major geographical ground for
                            species typical of Eastern and Southern Africa region and so extremely rich in endemic and rare
                            species not protected elsewhere in Tanzania.

                            This is often referred as the jewel of the Park, where small streams emerge from the grassy hill
                            sides sometimes cascading down in little waterfalls, thus forming the head waterfall for Nhumbe
                            river, one of the main tributary of the Great Ruaha River. The gap of the valley is occupied by
                            Juniper forest, one of the most extensive in East Africa. They tower to 50 m high and are indeed the
                            tallest junipers in the world.
